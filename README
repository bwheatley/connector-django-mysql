Experimental Django backend using MySQL Connector/Python
==============================================================================

Disclaimer
=====================

!!!!!!!!!!! THIS IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!! EXPECT THING TO NOT WORK OR GO WRONG !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!! DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION etc.. etc... !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Ah, and make backups! :-)

Dependencies
=====================

* Python 2.3 or greater.
* Django 1.2: http://www.djangoproject.com
* MySQL Connector/Python (currently in development)
  shell> bzr checkout lp:~mysql/myconnpy/main myconnpy
  shell> cd myconnpy
  shell> python setup.py install

Installation
=====================

To install the Django backend, do the following:
  shell> python ./setup.py install
  
It will install it in site-packages/mysql/django

Usage
=====================

To configure your Django project to use the backend, set the engine in
your settings.py like this:

DATABASE_ENGINE='mysql.django'

The above assumes you installed the mysql.django module somewhere where
Python can find it (see Installation).

Some caveats though:
* When you were using the DATABASE_OPTIONS and stored settings in an
  option file, that will not work anymore. Do it the normal Django way.
* You can't use UNIX Sockets (yet).
