Experimental Django backend using MySQL Connector/Python
==============================================================================

This has been updated (slightly) to work with Django 1.2's new database backend
API.

It has been tested (even more slightly) on a single read-only database with
trivial SELECT queries only. It Works For Me(tm).

Disclaimer
=====================

!!!!!!!!!!! THIS IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!! EXPECT THING TO NOT WORK OR GO WRONG !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!! DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION etc.. etc... !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Ah, and make backups! :-)

Dependencies
=====================

* Python 2.3 or greater.
* Django 1.2: http://www.djangoproject.com
* MySQL Connector/Python (currently in development)
  shell> bzr checkout lp:~mysql/myconnpy/main myconnpy
  shell> cd myconnpy
  shell> python setup.py install

Installation
=====================

To install the Django backend, do the following:
  shell> python ./setup.py install
  
It will install it in site-packages/myconnpy_django_backend

Usage
=====================

To configure your Django project to use the backend, set the engine in
your settings.py like this:

DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'myconnpy_django_backend',
# ...
}

The above assumes you installed the myconnpy_django_backend module somewhere
where Python can find it (see Installation).

Some caveats though:
* When you were using the DATABASE_OPTIONS and stored settings in an
  option file, that will not work anymore. Do it the normal Django way.
  (Maybe.)
* You can't use UNIX Sockets (yet).

Report problems
=====================

*Maybe* report problems to Geert Vanderkelen <geert.vanderkelen@sun.com>,
although he seems to no longer be maintaining this code. You can try reporting
problems to Jeremy Thurgood <firxen@gmail.com>, but I'm not actively
maintaining this at present, and only did a few basic copy/paste fixes
necessary to make it work for my (very simple) needs.
